C# Drill: Csharp_console
Title: Daily File Transfer scripting project - Csharp
Scenario: Your company's users create or edit a collection of text files throughout the day. These text files represent data about customer orders.
Once per day, any files that are new, or that were edited within the previous 24 hours, must be sent to the home office. To facilitate this, these new or updated files need to be copied to a specific 'destination' folder on a computer, so that a special file transfer program can grab them and transfer them to the home office.
The process of figuring out which files are new or recently edited, and copying them to the 'destination' folder, is currently being done manually. This is very expensive in terms of manpower.
You have been asked to create a script that will automate this task, saving the company a lot of money over the long term.
Guidelines:
Use C# on Visual Studio 2013 for this drill. The project type will be a 'Console Application'.
Your final application should have methods separate from the Main() method, and those functions should be called from within the Main() method in order to execute the 'file check' procedure.
You should create two folders; one to hold the files that get created or modified throughout the day, and another to receive the folders that your script determines should be copied over daily.
To aid in your development efforts, you should create .txt files to add to the first folder, using Notepad or similar program. You should also copy some older text files in there if you like. You should use files that you can edit, so that you can control whether they are meant to be detected as 'modified in the last 24 hours' by your program.
Once you create a functioning script that is approved by your instructor, save it for later use. Do not modify this saved copy during subsequent drills.
